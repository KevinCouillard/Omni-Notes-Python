**Omni-Notes Python**
=================
What is this?
=================

This is a conversion of Omni-Notes java version to python. It was created with the use of `The BeeWare Project`_ - essentially a collection of tools to help write python code, containing a native user interface and the libraries and support code to run an app on IOS, Android, Windows, etc.   

How to run this project?
=================

To run this project you need to install Python, perferrably 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8. You will also need to install git and `Briefcase`_. From here a BeeWare project space can be created anytime through the command console. For detailed information regarding the set up and use of BeeWare and it's tools, see the `Tutorial`_.  

Documentation
================

Currently no documentation for this project.
Access `Toga`_ documentation.

**This cross-platform app was generated by** `Briefcase`_ **- part of**
`The BeeWare Project`_. **If you want to see more tools like Briefcase, please

Current State
================

\-Basic front end implementation of toolbar and sidebar  

\-Basic front and backend implementation for the text/checklist note types  

\-Basic UI design from limitations in style options  

\-Repo is messy due to the BeeWare project file organization

Future State
================

I do not have many hopes for the expansion of this application as I created it to help myself learn Python.  

However, I moved this project to a Tkinter implementation b/c of the limitations of using Toga and BeeWare.
