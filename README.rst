What is this?
=================

This is a conversion of Omni-Notes java version to python. It was created with the use of `[The BeeWare Project](https://beeware.org/)` - essentially a collection of tools to help write python code with a native user interface and the libraries and support code to run an app on IOS, Android, Windows, etc.   

**This cross-platform app was generated by** `Briefcase`_ **- part of**
